# Shoestore - Basic E-commerce Website

This is an e-commerce shoe website. You can **filter** the shoes by brand or color(_the api I used couldn't handle multiple query parameters, so you can only filter by color or by brand_). Then You can go to the cart page and either checkout, or remove items from your cart. I used React's **useContext** hook for state management. The css framework is **Material UI**.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

**Gatsby**
Because my data wasn't changing at all, I preferred to use Gatsby in this project.

**Axios**
I made my API calls using axios.

**Material UI**
I used Material UI React components for this project, to get a fast prototype.

**mockAPI**
mockapi.io lets you create and modify a basic api for free, so I used them and arranged my data.

**Context API**
I used Context API to keep track of items in the cart.
